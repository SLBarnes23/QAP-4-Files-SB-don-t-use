<h2>Insurance Policy Information Generator for One Stop Insurance Company</h2>

Our new Policy Information Generator allows the user to clearly see the associated costs so there are no surprises when payment is due. It allows you to enter various information, such as but not limited to: number of cars being insured (the 25% discount of each supplemental car is automatically applied), enter what (if any) add-ons you want such as extra liability, glass coverage, and loaner car coverage. It also gives the user 3 payment options: full, monthly, or monthly with a downpayment (which of course will lower your monthly fee).

Once you enter your personal information, and answer the above questions the program will provide and itemized invoice, such as:

In the above example, the fictional user wanted to insure 2 cars, and said yes to extra liability, glass, and loaner car coverage - with their associated costs clearly visible. The program calculated their insurance premium with 2 vechiles, it added the extra costs listed above, noted that the user selected monthly payment  after a down payment amount of $250.00, calculated the HST and finally provided the total cost.

Under this information the user can also see their 3 latest claims, their date and their cost.
